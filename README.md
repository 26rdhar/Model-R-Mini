This is my code for the WizProdigy CyberTruck Competition, a US and Canada wide competition that I participated in from May 23 - June 13. The challenge was to build an individual model of the Tesla CyberTruck, mimicking its features and adding new ones. The top 10 designs (mine included) were submitted to Tesla engineers for them to consider in future models of the Tesla Cybertruck. This code (in arduino) allows the user to control the cybertruck with an IR Remote by moving forwards, backwards, left, and right. An LCD Display shows the actions respectively and LEDs indicate the movement of the cybertruck as a safety protocol. One may also activate the 'autopilot' mode in which the car will drive by itself. An ultrasonic sensor is attached to the front of the car as a safety protocol to ensure that the car doesn't hit any objects. If the car senses an object that is too close, the vehicle will move back and turn left in order to avoid the object. The keys for controlling the remote are given in the top of the code.
